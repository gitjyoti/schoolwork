		<h1>Short Term Goal</h1>
	</header>
		<h4>My short term goal is to finish my masters, study and learn more on software engineering and make my career in this field.</h4>
		<h3>Obstacles:</h3>
		<p>I have to work on the other subject I am TA for. For which I spend more time studying and doing the work than for my own course. Because this is my last semester, I also have to search for full time job for myself and most of my time goes in preparing myself studying for that. I also have to concentrate for my subjects that I do not miss out on them. All of these are very important for me, so I try to manage my time and priortize my time and sometimes I do miss out on one or other thing but I hope to achieve my short term goals and I will give my best effort to them.</p><br>

		<h4> My long term goal is to develop apps and which can make a bridge and open avenues to my countrymen. </h4>
		<h3>Obstacles:</h3>
		<p>	I have to learn to develop the kind of app I want to build. For this I will have to not only be good in programming and UI but also good in the industry I want to foray in. I am going to overcome this obstacle by gaining more knowledge and work in the field. I also want to be in touch with the industry experts of America and India so that they can give me proper insight of the market which in turn can help me serve large number of users. </p>

	<p>	It is interesting to write about my hobbies. When I think of my hobbies, the activities which come in my mind are some new and some old ones. The ones I love to do since I was a child are: sketching and making new plant friends by doing gardening.  </p>
	<p>	I used to love "sketching" and as I grew, I started to I love making portrait till I went to do under-graduation. It is not that I did not get time after that but somehow I could not get time to sit for hours to continue to sketch.	I still have a sketch book and my set of pencils.I sometimes think, someday... yes, I will sketch. I will draw something and I have drew once in a while but not to the perfection I used to draw. I used to get so engrossed in sketching that I would sit for hours without realising any hunger, pain or even time. </p> 
	<p></p> 
	<p>So, I must say sketching is my hobby because that is what I'd love to do in my leisure time. </p>			
	<p>	However, my another hobby which is "gardening" comparatively takes lesser time. I love it since the time I was taught in school that plants and trees are living beings. Till now whenever I get time I plant one or other thing and spend some of my time taking care of them. I usually plant flowers and from past few years I have been planting herbs, shrubs, vegetables and fruits.	<br>
	
		Apart from these ones these days, I do web browsing to learn more on my new found interest "web development".
		</p>
		<p>
		Currently I am learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. With these I want to develop some of the good websites. I like how neatly segregated HTML tags are and how cool JavaScript is. 
		Although this page is created using HTML I'd like to display how a JavaScript code looks like: <br>
		</p><pre>				console.log("This is JavaScript Example.")
				document.write("Allows JavaScript to write inside HTML.")
		</pre>

	<p>The first mobile phone to incorporate PDA features was an IBM prototype developed in 1992 and demonstrated that year at the COMDEX computer industry trade show. A refined version of the product was marketed to consumers in 1994 by BellSouth under the name Simon Personal Communicator. <b>The Simon</b> was the first cellular device that can be properly referred to as a "smartphone", although it was not called that in 1994.</p>

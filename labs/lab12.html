<h1>Google New CEO: Sundar Pichai </h1>
</header>
<article id="article1" >
	<section id="event"><h4>News:</h4><br>
	<p>Sundar Pichai's recent promotion to the CEO of Google is anything but a surprise â€” at least for one former employee.An ex-Googler who requested to remain anonymous said Pichai has shown that he's "CEO material" over the past few years. This person left the company recently after working at Google for several years. Sundar Pichai started at Google in 2004, when he was hired as the vice president of product management for Chrome. Over the years he's gained a ton of responsibility at Google, and in October he was put in charge of most of Google's core products, including Maps, Search, and commerce in addition to Chrome and Android.</p>

                			HaleakalÄ or the East Maui Volcano, is a massive shield volcano that forms more than 75% of the Hawaiian Island of Maui. The western 25% of the island is formed by another volcano, Mauna Kahalawai, also referred to as the West Maui Mountains. The tallest peak of HaleakalÄ ("house of the sun"), at 10,023 feet (3,055 m), is PuÊ»u Ê»UlaÊ»ula (Red Hill). From the summit one looks down into a massive depression some 11.25 km (7 mi) across, 3.2 km (2 mi) wide, and nearly 800 m (2,600 ft) deep. The surrounding walls are steep and the interior mostly barren-looking with a scattering of volcanic cones. To know more about history and origin of the mountain, please refer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haleakal%C4%81" target="_blank"> HaleakalÄ wiki page </a>

                			The Hana Highway (HI-360) is along Maui's rugged eastern coastline is the peaceful town of Hana. It is considered one of the last unspoiled Hawaiian frontiers. The legendary road to Hana is only 52 miles from Kahului, however the drive can take anywhere from two to four hours to complete since it's fraught with narrow one-lane bridges, hairpin turns and incredible island views. Hana has 620 curves and 59 bridges and the road leads through flourishing rainforests, flowing waterfalls, plunging pools and dramatic seascapes.
